# DnD-dice-roller

A dice rolling app designed specifically for Dungeons and Dragons, but can be used for a variety of different table-top role-playing games. 
Random rolls for d4; d6; d8; d10; d12; and 20 sided dice. Additional dice may be added to the roll if necessary. 

Designed for players in my current campaign that don't have a set of traditional dice!
