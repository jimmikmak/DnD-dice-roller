# DnD-dice-roller

A dice rolling app designed specifically for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, but can be used for a variety of different table-top role-playing games. 

# Features: 
- Roll one die individually
- View multiple results simultaneously
- Use multiple die of the same type and calculate totals for those big attack rolls!
- Select from a d4; d6; d8; d10; d12; or 20 sided-die.

Designed for players in my current campaign that don't have a set of traditional dice...and who are not good at math!!
